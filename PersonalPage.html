    <h1>Thoughts on Characteristics</h1>
    <h4>“I couldn't find the sports car of my dreams, so I built it myself.” The galvanized words by Ferdinand Porsche, founder of sports motorcars, that involve the sought out traits of an active learner. This quote revolves around the traits of being an active thinker and risk taker. Each characteristic holds a specific meaning of why they were chosen to be an active learner attribute.
	Every human being is born with something that is extremely underestimated, this thing is just referred to as an organ, a pulse sender, a big muscle, but the brain is actually out of the ordinary. The brain is astounding in all its intricate jobs it holds. The brain gives all human beings the trait of being a thinker. The trait of being a thinker is a given to all people, and it allows humans to be the dominant species on Earth. The reason I choose thinker is because it is something everyone has in common, and each person chooses whether they want to think or not. Being a thinker is an equal act, yet it depends on who wants to think outside the box, which is important for active learners.
	On top of being an essential thinker, to actually succeed as Ferdinand Porsche astonishingly did, you must be a risk-taker. The act of risk-taking tends to be frowned upon because people our too worried with what could go wrong rather than what could go right. Being an Active learner included risk-taking as a characteristic in the active learner profile because it believes we should all think outside the box and take initiative.
As an active learner, students, should be able to not be scared to take an exam, refute something a teacher says, or even stand up to what we believe in. Active learning gives students, including me, the chance to represent ourselves as young men and women instead of following the common pattern of going to class, pulling out a book, taking an exam, and being normal. Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, and Ferdinand Porsche should all be idols to active learners because they were willing to use their incredible brains to think, and they were the kind that did not mourn about the losses that could happen instead they took the risk. As being someone that is currently practicing active learning, I feel as if I am not only being educated for school, but rather an education for life.</h4>
